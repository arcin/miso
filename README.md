# RepoKit

## Before Installation

RepoKit requires a **Github Personal API Token** and a **Github Username** to make changes to the github server.  

### If you have an API token

You'll need to store your API token and github username as environment variables.  
Add the following lines to your .bashrc, .bash_profile, or .zshrc.

```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=your_username
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

### If you don't have an API token.

It's super easy to get one!
